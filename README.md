## What is an HTML element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: <br>
<tagname> content goes here... </tagname> <br>
The HTML <b>element</b> is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <br>
< h1 >My First Heading< /h1 > <br>
< p > This paraghraph.< /p > <br>
<pre>
<b>Starting tag</b>            <b>Element content</b>            <b>End tag</b>
< h1 >                  My First Heading           < /h1 > 
< p > 	                My first paragraph. 	   < /p >
< br > 	                none 	                   none
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> Some HTML elements have no content (like the < br > element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

## Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, it only display the content which is inside the tag.
